# Trestat.MsixShortcut

This library can read and write special Shell Link ItemIDs that allow desktop shortcuts to point to packaged apps, whether those are UWP, "Desktop Bridge," or Win32 apps, without the need for the app's AppxManifest to declare an AppExecutionAlias.

For best results, use this library with https://www.nuget.org/packages/securifybv.ShellLink to get power over things like icon resources.

See examples at https://github.com/Trestat/MsixShortcut.
